## The Consultation

#### Questionnaire
The first step is to complete a detailed Nutritional Health Questionnaire. [Click here to download ](/static/NHQ.pdf)

This provides information regarding your medical history, symptoms, lifestyle and current diet to enable a thorough assessment of your nutritional status.

#### Initial Consultation

The initial consultation usually lasts one hour. Having agreed on what you want to achieve and established a goal for your session, your health concerns and diet will be discussed and any questions will be addressed. Explanations of possible underlying problems will be made, how they may be affecting your health and most importantly what you may be able to do about them.

#### Recommendations

A personalized Health Optimization Plan will be agreed upon, which may include dietary changes, specific supplements, as needed, and lifestyle changes. These are made at a realistic level for you so that they are achievable. Practical support like menu planners can be provided. You will be given your Health Optimization Plan to take away with you.

Further tests may also be recommended if appropriate and if within your budget

#### Support
Telephone or email support is provided throughout the programme.

#### Follow up consultations

Usually last ½ - ¾ hour. You may typically need 2 – 4 visits over 3 – 6 months in order that your programme be developed and revised as you progress. However they can continue as frequently or infrequently as you feel you need to reach your goal.

All personal information is discussed in absolute confidence. Data is also entirely confidential and will not be passed to any third party.
