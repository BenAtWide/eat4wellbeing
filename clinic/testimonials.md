## Testimonials

“I have suffered with bloating and constipation for many years and had tried various diets without success. Jo was recommended to me and she arranged some tests for me to find out what was wrong. I followed a diet and supplement plan and started to feel better within a few weeks. I can now wear jeans and tight trousers without looking 6 months pregnant! I feel so much better.”  
**Julie, Brighton**

"I contacted Jo last year on account of Candida and digestive problems. In my first consultation, the advice she gave me as well as suggestions for supplements helped to solve the problem in two months. My follow-up consulations with Jo kept me on the right track."  
**Wendy, Penzance**

“I consulted Joanna after feeling increasingly ill and resorting to the internet when no suggestions were forthcoming from conventional medicine. Joanna  clearly understood every one of my symptoms and provided logical advice, a well organised programme of treatment and excellent support. After ten weeks I am fully recovered, and, as a bonus, have lost excess weight and got my blood sugar and blood pressure down!”  
**Mike, Mansfield**

 “Jo’s suggestions really helped with my menopausal symptoms – I feel like a new woman now”  
 **Carmel, Brighton**

“I have had chronic fatigue for the past 10 years as well as digestive problems, headaches and sinus problems. Jo has been very supportive over the past few months - my headaches have gone, my bloating is much better and I have more energy than I have had in ages. She was very patient and encouraging. I would definitely recommend her.”  
**Sue, Peacehaven**
